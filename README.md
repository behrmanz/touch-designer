# Zach's TouchDesigner Projects

This repository contains the source for many of my public projects. Anyone is more than welcome to use these contents as a starting-point for their own visual-arts projects. If you're interested in seeing visual examples, please consider giving [my visual arts page on Instagram a follow](https://www.instagram.com/0xninesix/)!

## Obligatory Warning

I am by no means an expert in TouchDesigner and as such, please do not take my solutions as best practice. If you know of more elegant solutions, please reach out!
